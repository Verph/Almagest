**Almagest: A True-to-Life Solar System!**

Ever wanted to build your empire among the stars, but felt that Minecraft’s simple sun and moon circling the world were just a bit too… mundane? With **Almagest**, you get a full-scale and explorable model of the solar system, faithfully following Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.  

Watch as planets gracefully orbit the sun with elliptical precision, their speeds dictated by the very laws that govern our cosmos. Time your space launches carefully—Earth won’t always be in the same spot! From Mercury’s blazing-fast orbit to Neptune’s distant, glacial crawl, to the icy reach of Sedna, dwelling in the farthest shadows of our cosmic neighborhood—experience the majesty of a living, breathing system where every heavenly body is in motion.  

So, strap in, grab a telescope, and set your sights on the stars—the universe is waiting for your grand adventure!
